<p><a name="index-tracepoint-packets-2753"></a><a name="index-packets_002c-tracepoint-2754"></a>
Here we describe the packets <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to implement
tracepoints (see <a href="Tracepoints.html#Tracepoints">Tracepoints</a>).

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP:</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>addr</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>ena</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>step</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>pass</var><span class="samp">[:F</span><var>flen</var><span class="samp">][:X</span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>bytes</var><span class="samp">][-]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bQTDP_007d-packet-2755"></a>Create a new tracepoint, number <var>n</var>, at <var>addr</var>.  If <var>ena</var>
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the tracepoint is enabled; if it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
the tracepoint is disabled.  <var>step</var> is the tracepoint's step
count, and <var>pass</var> is its pass count.  If an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; is present,
then the tracepoint is to be a fast tracepoint, and the <var>flen</var> is
the number of bytes that the target should copy elsewhere to make room
for the tracepoint.  If an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; is present, it introduces a
tracepoint condition, which consists of a hexadecimal length, followed
by a comma and hex-encoded bytes, in a manner similar to action
encodings as described below.  If the trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is present,
further &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets will follow to specify this tracepoint's
actions.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP:-</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>addr</var><span class="samp">:[S]</span><var>action</var><span class="samp">...[-]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Define actions to be taken when a tracepoint is hit.  <var>n</var> and
<var>addr</var> must be the same as in the initial &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packet for
this tracepoint.  This packet may only be sent immediately after
another &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packet that ended with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the
trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is present, further &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets will follow,
specifying more actions for this tracepoint.

     <p>In the series of action packets for a given tracepoint, at most one
can have an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; before its first <var>action</var>.  If such a packet
is sent, it and the following packets define &ldquo;while-stepping&rdquo;
actions.  Any prior packets define ordinary actions &mdash; that is, those
taken when the tracepoint is first hit.  If no action packet has an
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;, then all the packets in the series specify ordinary
tracepoint actions.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><var>action</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; portion of the packet is a series of
actions, concatenated without separators.  Each action has one of the
following forms:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R </span><var>mask</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Collect the registers whose bits are set in <var>mask</var>.  <var>mask</var> is
a hexadecimal number whose <var>i</var>'th bit is set if register number
<var>i</var> should be collected.  (The least significant bit is numbered
zero.)  Note that <var>mask</var> may be any number of digits long; it may
not fit in a 32-bit word.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M </span><var>basereg</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>offset</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>len</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Collect <var>len</var> bytes of memory starting at the address in register
number <var>basereg</var>, plus <var>offset</var>.  If <var>basereg</var> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the range has a fixed address: <var>offset</var> is the
address of the lowest byte to collect.  The <var>basereg</var>,
<var>offset</var>, and <var>len</var> parameters are all unsigned hexadecimal
values (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo; value for <var>basereg</var> is a special case).

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Evaluate <var>expr</var>, whose length is <var>len</var>, and collect memory as
it directs.  <var>expr</var> is an agent expression, as described in
<a href="Agent-Expressions.html#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>.  Each byte of the expression is encoded as a
two-digit hex number in the packet; <var>len</var> is the number of bytes
in the expression (and thus one-half the number of hex digits in the
packet).

     </dl>

     <p>Any number of actions may be packed together in a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo;
packet, as long as the packet does not exceed the maximum packet
length (400 bytes, for many stubs).  There may be only one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;
action per tracepoint, and it must precede any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo;
actions.  Any registers referred to by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; actions
must be collected by a preceding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; action.  (The
&ldquo;while-stepping&rdquo; actions are treated as if they were attached to a
separate tracepoint, as far as these restrictions are concerned.)

This is useful to get accurate reproduction of the tracepoints
originally downloaded at the beginning of the trace run.  <var>type</var>
is the name of the tracepoint part, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cond</span></samp>&rsquo; for the
tracepoint's conditional expression (see below for a list of types), while
<var>bytes</var> is the string, encoded in hexadecimal.

     <p><var>start</var> is the offset of the <var>bytes</var> within the overall source
string, while <var>slen</var> is the total length of the source string. 
This is intended for handling source strings that are longer than will
fit in a single packet. 
<!-- Add detailed example when this info is moved into a dedicated -->
<!-- tracepoint descriptions section. -->

     <p>The available string types are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">at</span></samp>&rsquo; for the location,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cond</span></samp>&rsquo; for the conditional, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cmd</span></samp>&rsquo; for an action command. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sends a separate packet for each command in the action
list, in the same order in which the commands are stored in the list.

     <p>The target does not need to do anything with source strings except
report them back as part of the replies to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTfP</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTsP</span></samp>&rsquo;
query packets.

     <p>Although this packet is optional, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> will only send it
if the target replies with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TracepointSource</span></samp>&rsquo; See <a href="General-Query-Packets.html#General-Query-Packets">General Query Packets</a>, it makes both disconnected tracing and trace files
much easier to use.  Otherwise the user must be careful that the
tracepoints in effect while looking at trace frames are identical to
the ones in effect during the trace run; even a small discrepancy
could cause &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tdump</span></samp>&rsquo; not to work, or a particular trace frame not
be found.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDV:</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-define-trace-state-variable_002c-remote-request-2757"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bQTDV_007d-packet-2758"></a>Create a new trace state variable, number <var>n</var>, with an initial
value of <var>value</var>, which is a 64-bit signed integer.  Both <var>n</var>
and <var>value</var> are encoded as hexadecimal values. <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
the option of not using this packet for initial values of zero; the
target should simply create the trace state variables as they are
mentioned in expressions.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTFrame:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bQTFrame_007d-packet-2759"></a>Select the <var>n</var>'th tracepoint frame from the buffer, and use the
register and memory contents recorded there to answer subsequent
request packets from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>A successful reply from the stub indicates that the stub has found the
requested frame.  The response is a series of parts, concatenated
without separators, describing the frame we selected.  Each part has
one of the following forms:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F </span><var>f</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The selected frame is number <var>n</var> in the trace frame buffer;
<var>f</var> is a hexadecimal number.  If <var>f</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo;, then there
was no frame matching the criteria in the request packet.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T </span><var>t</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The selected trace frame records a hit of tracepoint number <var>t</var>;
<var>t</var> is a hexadecimal number.

is a hexadecimal number.

currently selected frame whose PC is between <var>start</var> (inclusive)
and <var>end</var> (inclusive); <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are hexadecimal
numbers.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTFrame:outside:</span><var>start</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>end</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTFrame:range:</span><var>start</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>end</var></samp>&rsquo;, but select the first

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTMinFTPILen</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bqTMinFTPILen_007d-packet-2760"></a>This packet requests the minimum length of instruction at which a fast
tracepoint (see <a href="Set-Tracepoints.html#Set-Tracepoints">Set Tracepoints</a>) may be placed.  For instance, on
the 32-bit x86 architecture, it is possible to use a 4-byte jump, but
it depends on the target system being able to create trampolines in
the first 64K of memory, which might or might not be possible for that
system.  So the reply to this packet will be 4 if it is able to
arrange for that.

The stub
will answer requests for these ranges from memory's current contents,
if they were not collected as part of the tracepoint hit.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses this to mark read-only regions of memory, like those
containing program code.  Since these areas never change, they should
still have the same contents they did when the tracepoint was hit, so
there's no reason for the stub to refuse to provide their contents.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDisconnected:</span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bQTDisconnected_007d-packet-2767"></a>Set the choice to what to do with the tracing run when <span class="sc">gdb</span>

     <p>The reply has the form:

<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span><var>running</var><span class="samp">[;</span><var>field</var><span class="samp">]...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>running</var> is a single digit <code>1</code> if the trace is presently
running, or <code>0</code> if not.  It is followed by semicolon-separated
optional fields that an agent may use to report additional status.

     </dl>

     <p>If the trace is not running, the agent may report any of several
explanations as one of the optional fields:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tnotrun:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>No trace has been run yet.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tstop[:</span><var>text</var><span class="samp">]:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The trace was stopped by a user-originated stop command.  The optional
<var>text</var> field is a user-supplied string supplied as part of the
stop command (for instance, an explanation of why the trace was
stopped manually).  It is hex-encoded.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tfull:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The trace stopped because the trace buffer filled up.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tdisconnected:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The trace stopped because <span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnected from the target.

string <var>text</var> is available to describe the nature of the error
(for instance, a divide by zero in the condition expression). 
<var>text</var> is hex encoded.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tunknown:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The trace stopped for some other reason.

     </dl>

     <p>Additional optional fields supply statistical and other information. 
Although not required, they are extremely useful for users monitoring
the progress of a trace run.  If a trace has stopped, and these
numbers are reported, they must reflect the state of the just-stopped
trace.

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tframes:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The number of trace frames in the buffer.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tcreated:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The total number of trace frames created during the run. This may
be larger than the trace frame count, if the buffer is circular.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tsize:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The total size of the trace buffer, in bytes.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tfree:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The number of bytes still unused in the buffer.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">circular:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  <code>1</code> means that the
trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be discarded if
necessary to make room, <code>0</code> means that the trace buffer is linear
and may fill up.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">disconn:</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The value of the disconnected tracing flag.  <code>1</code> means that
tracing will continue after <span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnects, <code>0</code> means
that the trace run will stop.

     <p><var>address</var> is encoded in hex.

     <p>In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one or

<h4 class="subsection">E.6.1 Relocate instruction reply packet</h4>

<p>When installing fast tracepoints in memory, the target may need to
relocate the instruction currently at the tracepoint address to a
different address in memory.  For most instructions, a simple copy is
enough, but, for example, call instructions that implicitly push the
return address on the stack, and relative branches or other
PC-relative instructions require offset adjustment, so that the effect
of executing the instruction at a different address is the same as if
it had executed in the original location.

   <p>In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may also
respond with a number of intermediate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn</span></samp>&rsquo; request
packets before the final result packet, to have <span class="sc">gdb</span> handle
this relocation operation.  If a packet supports this mechanism, its
documentation will explicitly say so.  See for example the above
descriptions for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTStart</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets.  The
format of the request is:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn:</span><var>from</var><span class="samp">;</span><var>to</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
This requests <span class="sc">gdb</span> to copy instruction at address <var>from</var>
to address <var>to</var>, possibly adjusted so that executing the
instruction at <var>to</var> has the same effect as executing it at
<var>from</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> writes the adjusted instruction to target
memory starting at <var>to</var>. 
</dl>
