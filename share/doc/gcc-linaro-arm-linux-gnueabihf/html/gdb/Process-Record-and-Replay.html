<h2 class="chapter">7 Recording Inferior's Execution and Replaying It</h2>

<p><a name="index-process-record-and-replay-399"></a><a name="index-recording-inferior_0027s-execution-and-replaying-it-400"></a>
On some platforms, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a special <dfn>process record
and replay</dfn> target that can record a log of the process execution, and
replay it later with both forward and reverse execution commands.

   <p><a name="index-replay-mode-401"></a>When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record
for the next instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>replay
mode</dfn>.  In the replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code
instructions.  Instead, all the events that normally happen during
code execution are taken from the execution log.  While code is not
really executed in replay mode, the values of registers (including the
program counter register) and the memory of the inferior are still
changed as they normally would.  Their contents are taken from the
execution log.

   <p><a name="index-record-mode-402"></a>If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>record mode</dfn>.  In this mode, the
inferior executes normally, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> records the execution log
for future replay.

   <p>The process record and replay target supports reverse execution
(see <a href="Reverse-Execution.html#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>), even if the platform on which the
inferior runs does not.  However, the reverse execution is limited in
this case by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution
log.  In other words, reverse execution on platforms that don't
support it directly can only be done in the replay mode.

   <p>When debugging in the reverse direction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will work in
replay mode as long as the execution log includes the record for the
previous instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the
platform supports reverse execution, or stop if not.

   <p>For architecture environments that support process record and replay,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following commands:

     
<a name="index-target-record-403"></a>
<a name="index-target-record_002dfull-404"></a>
<a name="index-target-record_002dbtrace-405"></a>
<a name="index-record-406"></a>
<a name="index-record-full-407"></a>
<a name="index-record-btrace-408"></a>
<a name="index-rec-409"></a>
<a name="index-rec-full-410"></a>
<a name="index-rec-btrace-411"></a>
<dl><dt><code>record </code><var>method</var><dd>This command starts the process record and replay target.  The
recording method can be specified as parameter.  Without a parameter
the command uses the <code>full</code> recording method.  The following
recording methods are available:

          <dl>
<dt><code>full</code><dd>Full record/replay recording using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s software record and
replay implementation.  This method allows replaying and reverse
execution.

          <br><dt><code>btrace</code><dd>Hardware-supported instruction recording.  This method does not allow
replaying and reverse execution.

          <p>This recording method may not be available on all processors. 
</dl>

     <p>The process record and replay target can only debug a process that is
already running.  Therefore, you need first to start the process with
the <kbd>run</kbd> or <kbd>start</kbd> commands, and then start the recording
with the <kbd>record </kbd><var>method</var> command.

     <p>Both <code>record </code><var>method</var> and <code>rec </code><var>method</var> are
aliases of <code>target record-</code><var>method</var>.

     <p><a name="index-displaced-stepping_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-412"></a>Displaced stepping (see <a href="Maintenance-Commands.html#Maintenance-Commands">displaced stepping</a>)
will be automatically disabled when process record and replay target
is started.  That's because the process record and replay target
doesn't support displaced stepping.

     <p><a name="index-non_002dstop-mode_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-413"></a><a name="index-asynchronous-execution_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-414"></a>If the inferior is in the non-stop mode (see <a href="Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) or in
the asynchronous execution mode (see <a href="Background-Execution.html#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>), not
all recording methods are available.  The <code>full</code> recording method
does not support these two modes.

     <p><a name="index-record-stop-415"></a><a name="index-rec-s-416"></a><br><dt><code>record stop</code><dd>Stop the process record and replay target.  When process record and
replay target stops, the entire execution log will be deleted and the
inferior will either be terminated, or will remain in its final state.

     <p>When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode (at
the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at the
next instruction that would have been recorded.  In other words, if
you record for a while and then stop recording, the inferior process
will be left in the same state as if the recording never happened.

     <p>On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is stopped
while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the execution log,
but at some earlier point), the inferior process will become &ldquo;live&rdquo;
at that earlier state, and it will then be possible to continue the
usual &ldquo;live&rdquo; debugging of the process from that state.

     <p>When the inferior process exits, or <span class="sc">gdb</span> detaches from it,
process record and replay target will automatically stop itself.

     <p><a name="index-record-save-417"></a><br><dt><code>record save </code><var>filename</var><dd>Save the execution log to a file <samp><var>filename</var></samp>. 
Default filename is <samp><span class="file">gdb_record.</span><var>process_id</var></samp>, where
<var>process_id</var> is the process ID of the inferior.

     <p>This command may not be available for all recording methods.

     <p><a name="index-record-restore-418"></a><br><dt><code>record restore </code><var>filename</var><dd>Restore the execution log from a file <samp><var>filename</var></samp>. 
File must have been created with <code>record save</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-full-419"></a><br><dt><code>set record full insn-number-max </code><var>limit</var><dd>Set the limit of instructions to be recorded for the <code>full</code>
recording method.  Default value is 200000.

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is a positive number, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will start
deleting instructions from the log once the number of the record
instructions becomes greater than <var>limit</var>.  For every new recorded
instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will delete the earliest recorded
instruction to keep the number of recorded instructions at the limit. 
(Since deleting recorded instructions loses information, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
lets you control what happens when the limit is reached, by means of
the <code>stop-at-limit</code> option, described below.)

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is zero, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will never delete recorded
instructions from the execution log.  The number of recorded
instructions is unlimited in this case.

     <p><a name="index-show-record-full-420"></a><br><dt><code>show record full insn-number-max</code><dd>Show the limit of instructions to be recorded with the <code>full</code>
recording method.

     <br><dt><code>set record full stop-at-limit</code><dd>Control the behavior of the  <code>full</code> recording method when the
number of recorded instructions reaches the limit.  If ON (the
default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will stop when the limit is reached for the
first time and ask you whether you want to stop the inferior or
continue running it and recording the execution log.  If you decide
to continue recording, each new recorded instruction will cause the
oldest one to be deleted.

     <p>If this option is OFF, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically delete the
oldest record to make room for each new one, without asking.

     <br><dt><code>show record full stop-at-limit</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>stop-at-limit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set record full memory-query</code><dd>Control the behavior when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is unable to record memory
changes caused by an instruction for the <code>full</code> recording method. 
If ON, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will query whether to stop the inferior in that
case.

     <p>If this option is OFF (the default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically
ignore the effect of such instructions on memory.  Later, when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> replays this execution log, it will mark the log of this
instruction as not accessible, and it will not affect the replay
results.

     <br><dt><code>show record full memory-query</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>memory-query</code>.

     <p><a name="index-info-record-421"></a><br><dt><code>info record</code><dd>Show various statistics about the recording depending on the recording
method:

          <dl>
<dt><code>full</code><dd>For the <code>full</code> recording method, it shows the state of process
record and its in-memory execution log buffer, including:

               <ul>
<li>Whether in record mode or replay mode. 
<li>Lowest recorded instruction number (counting from when the current execution log started recording instructions). 
<li>Highest recorded instruction number. 
<li>Current instruction about to be replayed (if in replay mode). 
<li>Number of instructions contained in the execution log. 
<li>Maximum number of instructions that may be contained in the execution log. 
</ul>

          <br><dt><code>btrace</code><dd>For the <code>btrace</code> recording method, it shows the number of
instructions that have been recorded and the number of blocks of
sequential control-flow that is formed by the recorded instructions. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-record-delete-422"></a><a name="index-rec-del-423"></a><br><dt><code>record delete</code><dd>When record target runs in replay mode (&ldquo;in the past&rdquo;), delete the
subsequent execution log and begin to record a new execution log starting
from the current address.  This means you will abandon the previously
recorded &ldquo;future&rdquo; and begin recording a new &ldquo;future&rdquo;.

     <p><a name="index-record-instruction_002dhistory-424"></a><a name="index-rec-instruction_002dhistory-425"></a><br><dt><code>record instruction-history</code><dd>Disassembles instructions from the recorded execution log.  By
default, ten instructions are disassembled.  This can be changed using
the <code>set record instruction-history-size</code> command.  Instructions
are printed in execution order.  There are several ways to specify
what part of the execution log to disassemble:

          <dl>
<dt><code>record instruction-history </code><var>insn</var><dd>Disassembles ten instructions starting from instruction number
<var>insn</var>.

          <br><dt><code>record instruction-history </code><var>insn</var><code>, +/-</code><var>n</var><dd>Disassembles <var>n</var> instructions around instruction number
<var>insn</var>.  If <var>n</var> is preceded with <code>+</code>, disassembles
<var>n</var> instructions after instruction number <var>insn</var>.  If
<var>n</var> is preceded with <code>-</code>, disassembles <var>n</var>
instructions before instruction number <var>insn</var>.

          <br><dt><code>record instruction-history</code><dd>Disassembles ten more instructions after the last disassembly.

          <br><dt><code>record instruction-history -</code><dd>Disassembles ten more instructions before the last disassembly.

          <br><dt><code>record instruction-history </code><var>begin</var> <var>end</var><dd>Disassembles instructions beginning with instruction number
<var>begin</var> until instruction number <var>end</var>.  The instruction
number <var>end</var> is not included.

     <p>This command may not be available for all recording methods.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-426"></a><br><dt><code>set record instruction-history-size</code><dd>Define how many instructions to disassemble in the <code>record

for this instruction sequence (if the <code>/l</code> modifier is
specified), and the instructions numbers that form the sequence (if
the <code>/i</code> modifier is specified).
