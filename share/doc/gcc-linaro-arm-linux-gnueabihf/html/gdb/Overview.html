<h3 class="section">E.1 Overview</h3>

<p>There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol&mdash;for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>In the examples below, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; are used to indicate
transmitted and received data, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-protocol_002c-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-serial-2633"></a><a name="index-serial-protocol_002c-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-2634"></a><a name="index-remote-serial-protocol-2635"></a>All <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands and responses (other than acknowledgments
and notifications, see <a href="Notification-Packets.html#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) are sent as a
<var>packet</var>.  A <var>packet</var> is introduced with the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, the actual <var>packet-data</var>, and the terminating character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a two-digit <var>checksum</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>$</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-checksum_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-2636"></a>The two-digit <var>checksum</var> is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and the trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; (an
eight bit unsigned checksum).

   <p>Implementors should note that prior to <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit <var>sequence-id</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>$</code><var>sequence-id</var><code>:</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-sequence_002did_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-2637"></a>That <var>sequence-id</var> was appended to the acknowledgment.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
has never output <var>sequence-id</var>s.  Stubs that handle packets added
since <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0 must not accept <var>sequence-id</var>.

   <p>When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgment: either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; (to request
retransmission):

<pre class="smallexample">     -&gt; <code>$</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
     &lt;- <code>+</code>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgments can be disabled
once a connection is established. 
See <a href="Packet-Acknowledgment.html#Packet-Acknowledgment">Packet Acknowledgment</a>, for details.

   <p>The host (<span class="sc">gdb</span>) sends <var>command</var>s, and the target (the
debugging stub incorporated in your program) sends a <var>response</var>.  In
the case of step and continue <var>command</var>s, the response is only sent
when the operation has completed, and the target has again stopped all
threads in all attached processes.  This is the default all-stop mode
behavior, but the remote protocol also supports <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s non-stop
execution mode; see <a href="Remote-Non_002dStop.html#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>, for details.

   <p><var>packet-data</var> consists of a sequence of characters with the
exception of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; (see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; packet for additional
exceptions).

   <p><a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-field-separator-2638"></a>Fields within the packet should be separated using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in
<span class="sc">hex</span> with leading zeros suppressed.

   <p>Implementors should note that prior to <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0, the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it
would potentially conflict with the <var>sequence-id</var>).

   <p><a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-binary-data-2639"></a><a name="Binary-Data"></a>Binary data in most packets is encoded either as two hexadecimal
digits per byte of binary data.  This allowed the traditional remote
protocol to work over connections which were only seven-bit clean. 
Some packets designed more recently assume an eight-bit clean
connection, and use a more efficient encoding to send and receive
binary data.

   <p>The binary data representation uses <code>7d</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;)
as an escape character.  Any escaped byte is transmitted as the escape
character followed by the original character XORed with <code>0x20</code>. 
For example, the byte <code>0x7d</code> would be transmitted as the two
bytes <code>0x7d 0x5d</code>.  The bytes <code>0x23</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;),
<code>0x24</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;), and <code>0x7d</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;) must always be escaped.  Responses sent by the stub
must also escape <code>0x2a</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;), so that it
is not interpreted as the start of a run-length encoded sequence
(described next).

   <p>Response <var>data</var> can be run-length encoded to save space. 
Run-length encoding replaces runs of identical characters with one
instance of the repeated character, followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and a
repeat count.  The repeat count is itself sent encoded, to avoid
binary characters in <var>data</var>: a value of <var>n</var> is sent as
<var>n</var><code>+29</code>.  For a repeat count greater or equal to 3, this
produces a printable <span class="sc">ascii</span> character, e.g. a space (<span class="sc">ascii</span>
code 32) for a repeat count of 3.  (This is because run-length
encoding starts to win for counts 3 or more.)  Thus, for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0* </span></samp>&rsquo; is a run-length encoding of &ldquo;0000&rdquo;: the space character
after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; means repeat the leading <code>0</code> <code>32&nbsp;-&nbsp;29&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</code><!-- /@w --> more times.

   <p>The printable characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; or with a numeric value
greater than 126 must not be used.  Runs of six repeats (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) or
seven repeats (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;) can be expanded using a repeat count of only
five (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;).  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">00000000</span></samp>&rsquo; can be encoded as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0*"00</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number.  That number is not well defined.

   <p><a name="index-empty-response_002c-for-unsupported-packets-2640"></a>For any <var>command</var> not supported by the stub, an empty response
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$#00</span></samp>&rsquo;) should be returned.  That way it is possible to extend the
protocol.  A newer <span class="sc">gdb</span> can tell if a packet is supported based
on that response.

   <p>At a minimum, a stub is required to support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo;
commands for register access, and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; commands
for memory access.  Stubs that only control single-threaded targets
can implement run control with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; (continue), and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;
(step) commands.  Stubs that support multi-threading targets should
support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vCont</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  All other commands are optional.
