<h3 class="section">G.4 Standard Target Features</h3>

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-standard-features-2852"></a>
A target description must contain either no registers or all the
target's registers.  If the description contains no registers, then
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will assume a default register layout, selected based on
the architecture.  If the description contains any registers, the
default layout will not be used; the standard registers must be
described in the target description, in such a way that <span class="sc">gdb</span>
can recognize them.

   <p>This is accomplished by giving specific names to feature elements
which contain standard registers.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for features
with those names and verify that they contain the expected registers;
if any known feature is missing required registers, or if any required
feature is missing, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will reject the target
description.  You can add additional registers to any of the
standard features &mdash; <span class="sc">gdb</span> will display them just as if
they were added to an unrecognized feature.

   <p>This section lists the known features and their expected contents. 
Sample XML documents for these features are included in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> source tree, in the directory <samp><span class="file">gdb/features</span></samp>.

   <p>Names recognized by <span class="sc">gdb</span> should include the name of the
company or organization which selected the name, and the overall
architecture to which the feature applies; so e.g. the feature
containing ARM core registers is named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The names of registers are not case sensitive for the purpose
of recognizing standard features, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> will only display
registers using the capitalization used in the description.
