<h4 class="subsection">27.5.4 <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Breakpoint Information</h4>

<p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> reports information about a breakpoint, a
tracepoint, a watchpoint, or a catchpoint, it uses a tuple with the
following fields:

     <dl>
<dt><code>number</code><dd>The breakpoint number.  For a breakpoint that represents one location
of a multi-location breakpoint, this will be a dotted pair, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>type</code><dd>The type of the breakpoint.  For ordinary breakpoints this will be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">breakpoint</span></samp>&rsquo;, but many values are possible.

     <br><dt><code>catch-type</code><dd>If the type of the breakpoint is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">catchpoint</span></samp>&rsquo;, then this
indicates the exact type of catchpoint.

     <br><dt><code>disp</code><dd>This is the breakpoint disposition&mdash;either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">del</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning that
the breakpoint will be deleted at the next stop, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">keep</span></samp>&rsquo;,
meaning that the breakpoint will not be deleted.

     <br><dt><code>enabled</code><dd>This indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled, in which case the
value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, or disabled, in which case the value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that this is not the same as the field <code>enable</code>.

     <br><dt><code>addr</code><dd>The address of the breakpoint.  This may be a hexidecimal number,
giving the address; or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;PENDING&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, for a pending
breakpoint; or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, for a breakpoint with
multiple locations.  This field will not be present if no address can
be determined.  For example, a watchpoint does not have an address.

     <br><dt><code>func</code><dd>If known, the function in which the breakpoint appears. 
If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>filename</code><dd>The name of the source file which contains this function, if known. 
If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>fullname</code><dd>The full file name of the source file which contains this function, if
known.  If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>line</code><dd>The line number at which this breakpoint appears, if known. 
If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>at</code><dd>If the source file is not known, this field may be provided.  If
provided, this holds the address of the breakpoint, possibly followed
by a symbol name.

     <br><dt><code>pending</code><dd>If this breakpoint is pending, this field is present and holds the
text used to set the breakpoint, as entered by the user.

     <br><dt><code>evaluated-by</code><dd>Where this breakpoint's condition is evaluated, either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>thread</code><dd>If this is a thread-specific breakpoint, then this identifies the
thread in which the breakpoint can trigger.

     <br><dt><code>task</code><dd>If this breakpoint is restricted to a particular Ada task, then this
field will hold the task identifier.

     <br><dt><code>cond</code><dd>If the breakpoint is conditional, this is the condition expression.

     <br><dt><code>ignore</code><dd>The ignore count of the breakpoint.

     <br><dt><code>enable</code><dd>The enable count of the breakpoint.

     <br><dt><code>traceframe-usage</code><dd>FIXME.

     <br><dt><code>static-tracepoint-marker-string-id</code><dd>For a static tracepoint, the name of the static tracepoint marker.

     <br><dt><code>mask</code><dd>For a masked watchpoint, this is the mask.

     <br><dt><code>pass</code><dd>A tracepoint's pass count.

     <br><dt><code>original-location</code><dd>The location of the breakpoint as originally specified by the user. 
This field is optional.

     <br><dt><code>times</code><dd>The number of times the breakpoint has been hit.

     <br><dt><code>installed</code><dd>This field is only given for tracepoints.  This is either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
meaning that the tracepoint is installed, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning that it
is not.

     <br><dt><code>what</code><dd>Some extra data, the exact contents of which are type-dependent.

   </dl>

   <p>For example, here is what the output of <code>-break-insert</code>
(see <a href="GDB_002fMI-Breakpoint-Commands.html#GDB_002fMI-Breakpoint-Commands">GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands</a>) might be:

<pre class="smallexample">     -&gt; -break-insert main
     &lt;- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
         enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",
         fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68",thread-groups=["i1"],
         times="0"}
     &lt;- (gdb)
</pre>
