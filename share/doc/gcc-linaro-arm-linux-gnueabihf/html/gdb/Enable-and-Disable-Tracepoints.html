<h4 class="subsection">13.1.2 Enable and Disable Tracepoints</h4>

<p>These commands are deprecated; they are equivalent to plain <code>disable</code> and <code>enable</code>.

     
<a name="index-disable-tracepoint-764"></a>
<dl><dt><code>disable tracepoint </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>num</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Disable tracepoint <var>num</var>, or all tracepoints if no argument
<var>num</var> is given.  A disabled tracepoint will have no effect during
a trace experiment, but it is not forgotten.  You can re-enable
a disabled tracepoint using the <code>enable tracepoint</code> command. 
If the command is issued during a trace experiment and the debug target
has support for disabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the
change will be effective immediately.  Otherwise, it will be applied to the
next trace experiment.

issued during a trace experiment and the debug target supports enabling
tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the enabled tracepoints will
become effective immediately.  Otherwise, they will become effective the
next time a trace experiment is run.
