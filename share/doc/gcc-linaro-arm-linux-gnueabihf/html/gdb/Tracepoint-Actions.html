<h4 class="subsection">13.1.6 Tracepoint Action Lists</h4>

     
<a name="index-actions-775"></a>
<a name="index-tracepoint-actions-776"></a>
<dl><dt><code>actions </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>num</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>This command will prompt for a list of actions to be taken when the
tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number <var>num</var> is not
specified, this command sets the actions for the one that was most
recently defined (so that you can define a tracepoint and then say
<code>actions</code> without bothering about its number).  You specify the
actions themselves on the following lines, one action at a time, and
terminate the actions list with a line containing just <code>end</code>.  So
far, the only defined actions are <code>collect</code>, <code>teval</code>, and
<code>while-stepping</code>.

     <p><code>actions</code> is actually equivalent to <code>commands</code> (see <a href="Break-Commands.html#Break-Commands">Breakpoint Command Lists</a>), except that only the defined
actions are allowed; any other <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is rejected.

     <p><a name="index-remove-actions-from-a-tracepoint-777"></a>To remove all actions from a tracepoint, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">actions </span><var>num</var></samp>&rsquo;
and follow it immediately with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">end</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <b>collect </b><var>data</var> // collect some data
          
          (gdb) <b>while-stepping 5</b> // single-step 5 times, collect data
          
          (gdb) <b>end</b>              // signals the end of actions.
</pre>
     <p>In the following example, the action list begins with <code>collect</code>
commands indicating the things to be collected when the tracepoint is
hit.  Then, in order to single-step and collect additional data
following the tracepoint, a <code>while-stepping</code> command is used,
followed by the list of things to be collected after each step in a
sequence of single steps.  The <code>while-stepping</code> command is
terminated by its own separate <code>end</code> command.  Lastly, the action
list is terminated by an <code>end</code> command.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <b>trace foo</b>
          (gdb) <b>actions</b>
          Enter actions for tracepoint 1, one per line:
          &gt; collect bar,baz
          &gt; collect $regs
          &gt; while-stepping 12
            &gt; collect $pc, arr[i]
            &gt; end
          end
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-collect-_0040r_007b_0028tracepoints_0029_007d-778"></a><br><dt><code>collect</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>/</code><var>mods</var><span class="roman">]</span> <var>expr1</var><code>, </code><var>expr2</var><code>, ...</code><dd>Collect values of the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit. 
This command accepts a comma-separated list of any valid expressions. 
In addition to global, static, or local variables, the following
special arguments are supported:

          <dl>
<dt><code>$regs</code><dd>Collect all registers.

          <br><dt><code>$args</code><dd>Collect all function arguments.

          <br><dt><code>$locals</code><dd>Collect all local variables.

          <br><dt><code>$_ret</code><dd>Collect the return address.  This is helpful if you want to see more
of a backtrace.

          <br><dt><code>$_probe_argc</code><dd>Collects the number of arguments from the static probe at which the
tracepoint is located. 
See <a href="Static-Probe-Points.html#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>.

          <br><dt><code>$_probe_arg</code><var>n</var><dd><var>n</var> is an integer between 0 and 11.  Collects the <var>n</var>th argument
from the static probe at which the tracepoint is located. 
See <a href="Static-Probe-Points.html#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>.

          <br><dt><code>$_sdata</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fsdata_0040r_007b_002c-collect_007d-779"></a>Collect static tracepoint marker specific data.  Only available for
static tracepoints.  See <a href="Tracepoint-Actions.html#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>.  On the UST static tracepoints library backend, an
instrumentation point resembles a <code>printf</code> function call.  The
tracing library is able to collect user specified data formatted to a
character string using the format provided by the programmer that
instrumented the program.  Other backends have similar mechanisms. 
Here's an example of a UST marker call:

          <pre class="smallexample">                const char master_name[] = "$your_name";
                trace_mark(channel1, marker1, "hello %s", master_name)
</pre>
          <p>In this case, collecting <code>$_sdata</code> collects the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hello $yourname</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When analyzing the trace buffer, you can
inspect &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$_sdata</span></samp>&rsquo; like any other variable available to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
</dl>

     <p>You can give several consecutive <code>collect</code> commands, each one
with a single argument, or one <code>collect</code> command with several
arguments separated by commas; the effect is the same.

     <p>The optional <var>mods</var> changes the usual handling of the arguments. 
<code>s</code> requests that pointers to chars be handled as strings, in
particular collecting the contents of the memory being pointed at, up
to the first zero.  The upper bound is by default the value of the
<code>print elements</code> variable; if <code>s</code> is followed by a decimal
number, that is the upper bound instead.  So for instance
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">collect/s25 mystr</span></samp>&rsquo; collects as many as 25 characters at
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mystr</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>The command <code>info scope</code> (see <a href="Symbols.html#Symbols">info scope</a>) is
particularly useful for figuring out what data to collect.

     <p><a name="index-teval-_0040r_007b_0028tracepoints_0029_007d-780"></a><br><dt><code>teval </code><var>expr1</var><code>, </code><var>expr2</var><code>, ...</code><dd>Evaluate the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.  This
command accepts a comma-separated list of expressions.  The results
are discarded, so this is mainly useful for assigning values to trace
state variables (see <a href="Trace-State-Variables.html#Trace-State-Variables">Trace State Variables</a>) without adding those
values to the trace buffer, as would be the case if the <code>collect</code>
action were used.

     <p><a name="index-while_002dstepping-_0040r_007b_0028tracepoints_0029_007d-781"></a><br><dt><code>while-stepping </code><var>n</var><dd>Perform <var>n</var> single-step instruction traces after the tracepoint,
collecting new data after each step.  The <code>while-stepping</code>
command is followed by the list of what to collect while stepping
(followed by its own <code>end</code> command):

     <pre class="smallexample">          &gt; while-stepping 12
            &gt; collect $regs, myglobal
            &gt; end
          &gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that <code>$pc</code> is not automatically collected by
<code>while-stepping</code>; you need to explicitly collect that register if
you need it.  You may abbreviate <code>while-stepping</code> as <code>ws</code> or
<code>stepping</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set default-collect </code><var>expr1</var><code>, </code><var>expr2</var><code>, ...</code><dd><a name="index-set-default_002dcollect-782"></a><a name="index-default-collection-action-783"></a>This variable is a list of expressions to collect at each tracepoint
hit.  It is effectively an additional <code>collect</code> action prepended
to every tracepoint action list.  The expressions are parsed
individually for each tracepoint, so for instance a variable named
<code>xyz</code> may be interpreted as a global for one tracepoint, and a
local for another, as appropriate to the tracepoint's location.

     <br><dt><code>show default-collect</code><dd><a name="index-show-default_002dcollect-784"></a>Show the list of expressions that are collected by default at each
tracepoint hit.

</dl>
