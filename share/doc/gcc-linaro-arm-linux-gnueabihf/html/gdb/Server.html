<h3 class="section">20.3 Using the <code>gdbserver</code> Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-gdbserver-1176"></a><a name="index-remote-connection-without-stubs-1177"></a><code>gdbserver</code> is a control program for Unix-like systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> via
<code>target remote</code>&mdash;but without linking in the usual debugging stub.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself does.  In fact, a system that can run
<code>gdbserver</code> to connect to a remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> could also run
<span class="sc">gdb</span> locally!  <code>gdbserver</code> is sometimes useful nevertheless,
because it is a much smaller program than <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself.  It is
also easier to port than all of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, so you may be able to get
started more quickly on a new system by using <code>gdbserver</code>. 
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use <code>gdbserver</code> to make a similar
choice for debugging.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> and <code>gdbserver</code> communicate via either a serial line
or a TCP connection, using the standard <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote serial
protocol.

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> <code>gdbserver</code> does not have any built-in security. 
Do not run <code>gdbserver</code> connected to any public network; a
<span class="sc">gdb</span> connection to <code>gdbserver</code> provides access to the
target system with the same privileges as the user running
<code>gdbserver</code>. 
</blockquote>

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.1 Running <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-arguments_002c-to-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1178"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d_002c-command_002dline-arguments-1179"></a>
Run <code>gdbserver</code> on the target system.  You need a copy of the
program you want to debug, including any libraries it requires. 
<code>gdbserver</code> does not need your program's symbol table, so you can
strip the program if necessary to save space.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host
system does all the symbol handling.

   <p>To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>;
the name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The usual
syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>program</var> [ <var>args</var> ... ]
</pre>
   <p><var>comm</var> is either a device name (to use a serial line), or a TCP
hostname and portnumber, or <code>-</code> or <code>stdio</code> to use
stdin/stdout of <code>gdbserver</code>. 
For example, to debug Emacs with the argument
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.txt</span></samp>&rsquo; and communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span> over the serial port
<samp><span class="file">/dev/com1</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p><code>gdbserver</code> waits passively for the host <span class="sc">gdb</span> to communicate
with it.

   <p>To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p>The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host <span class="sc">gdb</span> via
TCP.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host:2345</span></samp>&rsquo; argument means that <code>gdbserver</code> is to
expect a TCP connection from machine &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; to local TCP port 2345. 
(Currently, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; part is ignored.)  You can choose any number
you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any
TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, <code>23</code> is
reserved for <code>telnet</code>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  You must use the same port number with the host <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>target remote</code> command.

   <p>The <code>stdio</code> connection is useful when starting <code>gdbserver</code>
with ssh:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) target remote | ssh -T hostname gdbserver - hello
</pre>
   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>&rsquo; option to ssh is provided because we don't need a remote pty,
and we don't want escape-character handling.  Ssh does this by default when
a command is provided, the flag is provided to make it explicit. 
You could elide it if you want to.

   <p>Programs started with stdio-connected gdbserver have <samp><span class="file">/dev/null</span></samp> for
<code>stdin</code>, and <code>stdout</code>,<code>stderr</code> are sent back to gdb for
display through a pipe connected to gdbserver. 
Both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> use the same pipe.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.1 Attaching to a Running Program</h5>

<p><a name="index-attach-to-a-program_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1180"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dattach_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1181"></a>
On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> can also attach to running programs. 
This is accomplished via the <code>--attach</code> argument.  The syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre>
   <p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't necessary
to point <code>gdbserver</code> at a binary for the running process.

   <p><a name="index-pidof-1182"></a>You can debug processes by name instead of process ID if your target has the
<code>pidof</code> utility:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> `pidof <var>program</var>`
</pre>
   <p>In case more than one copy of <var>program</var> is running, or <var>program</var>
has multiple threads, most versions of <code>pidof</code> support the
<code>-s</code> option to only return the first process ID.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.2 Multi-Process Mode for <code>gdbserver</code></h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d_002c-multiple-processes-1183"></a><a name="index-multiple-processes-with-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1184"></a>
When you connect to <code>gdbserver</code> using <code>target remote</code>,
<code>gdbserver</code> debugs the specified program only once.  When the
program exits, or you detach from it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> closes the connection
and <code>gdbserver</code> exits.

   <p>If you connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>, <code>gdbserver</code>
enters multi-process mode.  When the debugged program exits, or you
detach from it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stays connected to <code>gdbserver</code> even
though no program is running.  The <code>run</code> and <code>attach</code>
commands instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to run or attach to a new program. 
The <code>run</code> command uses <code>set remote exec-file</code> (see <a href="set-remote-exec_002dfile.html#set-remote-exec_002dfile">set remote exec-file</a>) to select the program to run.  Command line
arguments are supported, except for wildcard expansion and I/O
redirection (see <a href="Arguments.html#Arguments">Arguments</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dmulti_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1185"></a>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use the <samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> command line option. 
Then you can connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> and start
the program you want to debug.

   <p>In multi-process mode <code>gdbserver</code> does not automatically exit unless you
use the option <samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp>.  You can terminate it by using
<code>monitor exit</code> (see <a href="Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver.html#Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver">Monitor Commands for gdbserver</a>).  Note that the
conditions under which <code>gdbserver</code> terminates depend on how <span class="sc">gdb</span>
connects to it (<kbd>target remote</kbd> or <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>).  The
<samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> option to <code>gdbserver</code> has no influence on that.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.3 TCP port allocation lifecycle of <code>gdbserver</code></h5>

<p>This section applies only when <code>gdbserver</code> is run to listen on a TCP port.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> normally terminates after all of its debugged processes have
terminated in <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.  On the other hand, for <kbd>target
extended-remote</kbd>, <code>gdbserver</code> stays running even with no processes left. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> normally terminates the spawned debugged process on its exit,
which normally also terminates <code>gdbserver</code> in the <kbd>target remote</kbd>
mode.  Therefore, when the connection drops unexpectedly, and <span class="sc">gdb</span>
cannot ask <code>gdbserver</code> to kill its debugged processes, <code>gdbserver</code>
stays running even in the <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.

   <p>When <code>gdbserver</code> stays running, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can connect to it again later. 
Such reconnecting is useful for features like <a href="disconnected-tracing.html#disconnected-tracing">disconnected tracing</a>.  For
completeness, at most one <span class="sc">gdb</span> can be connected at a time.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002donce_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1186"></a>By default, <code>gdbserver</code> keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
additional connections are possible.  However, if you start <code>gdbserver</code>
with the <samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp> option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first <span class="sc">gdb</span> session.  This
means no further connections to <code>gdbserver</code> will be possible after the
first one.  It also means <code>gdbserver</code> will terminate after the first
connection with remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> has closed, even for unexpectedly closed
connections and even in the <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> mode.  The
<samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp> option allows reusing the same port number for connecting to
multiple instances of <code>gdbserver</code> running on the same host, since each
instance closes its port after the first connection.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.4 Other Command-Line Arguments for <code>gdbserver</code></h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002ddebug_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1187"></a>The <samp><span class="option">--debug</span></samp> option tells <code>gdbserver</code> to display extra
status information about the debugging process. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dremote_002ddebug_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1188"></a>The <samp><span class="option">--remote-debug</span></samp> option tells <code>gdbserver</code> to display
remote protocol debug output.  These options are intended for
<code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to the developers.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dwrapper_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1189"></a>The <samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> option specifies a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
<kbd>--</kbd> indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> runs the specified wrapper program with a combined
command line including the wrapper arguments, then the name of the
program to debug, then any arguments to the program.  The wrapper
runs until it executes your program, and then <span class="sc">gdb</span> gains control.

   <p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec "$@"</code> will also work.

   <p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in <code>gdbserver</code>'s
environment:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdbserver --wrapper env LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so -- :2222 ./testprog
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">20.3.2 Connecting to <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p>Run <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host system.

   <p>First make sure you have the necessary symbol files.  Load symbols for
your application using the <code>file</code> command before you connect.  Use
<code>set sysroot</code> to locate target libraries (unless your <span class="sc">gdb</span>
was compiled with the correct sysroot using <code>--with-sysroot</code>).

   <p>The symbol file and target libraries must exactly match the executable
and libraries on the target, with one exception: the files on the host
system should not be stripped, even if the files on the target system
are.  Mismatched or missing files will lead to confusing results
during debugging.  On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux targets, mismatched or missing
files may also prevent <code>gdbserver</code> from debugging multi-threaded
programs.

   <p>Connect to your target (see <a href="Connecting.html#Connecting">Connecting to a Remote Target</a>). 
For TCP connections, you must start up <code>gdbserver</code> prior to using
the <code>target remote</code> command.  Otherwise you may get an error whose
text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Connection refused</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Don't use the <code>load</code>
command in <span class="sc">gdb</span> when using <code>gdbserver</code>, since the program is
already on the target.

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.3 Monitor Commands for <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-monitor-commands_002c-for-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1190"></a><a name="Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver"></a>During a <span class="sc">gdb</span> session using <code>gdbserver</code>, you can use the
<code>monitor</code> command to send special requests to <code>gdbserver</code>. 
Here are the available commands.

     <dl>
<dt><code>monitor help</code><dd>List the available monitor commands.

     <br><dt><code>monitor set debug 0</code><dt><code>monitor set debug 1</code><dd>Disable or enable general debugging messages.

     <br><dt><code>monitor set remote-debug 0</code><dt><code>monitor set remote-debug 1</code><dd>Disable or enable specific debugging messages associated with the remote
protocol (see <a href="Remote-Protocol.html#Remote-Protocol">Remote Protocol</a>).

     <br><dt><code>monitor set libthread-db-search-path [PATH]</code><dd><a name="index-gdbserver_002c-search-path-for-_0040code_007blibthread_005fdb_007d-1191"></a>When this command is issued, <var>path</var> is a colon-separated list of
directories to search for <code>libthread_db</code> (see <a href="Threads.html#Threads">set libthread-db-search-path</a>).  If you omit <var>path</var>,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>&rsquo; will be reset to its default value.

     <p>The special entry &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$pdir</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>&rsquo; is
not supported in <code>gdbserver</code>.

     <br><dt><code>monitor exit</code><dd>Tell gdbserver to exit immediately.  This command should be followed by
<code>disconnect</code> to close the debugging session.  <code>gdbserver</code> will
detach from any attached processes and kill any processes it created. 
Use <code>monitor exit</code> to terminate <code>gdbserver</code> at the end
of a multi-process mode debug session.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.4 Tracepoints support in <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-tracepoints-support-in-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1192"></a>
On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> supports tracepoints, fast
tracepoints and static tracepoints.

   <p>For fast or static tracepoints to work, a special library called the
<dfn>in-process agent</dfn> (IPA), must be loaded in the inferior process. 
This library is built and distributed as an integral part of
<code>gdbserver</code>.  In addition, support for static tracepoints
requires building the in-process agent library with static tracepoints
support.  At present, the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer,
<a href="http://lttng.org/ust">http://lttng.org/ust</a>) tracing engine is supported.  This support
is automatically available if UST development headers are found in the
standard include path when <code>gdbserver</code> is built, or if
<code>gdbserver</code> was explicitly configured using <samp><span class="option">--with-ust</span></samp>
to point at such headers.  You can explicitly disable the support
using <samp><span class="option">--with-ust=no</span></samp>.

   <p>There are several ways to load the in-process agent in your program:

     <dl>
<dt><code>Specifying it as dependency at link time</code><dd>
You can link your program dynamically with the in-process agent
library.  On most systems, this is accomplished by adding
<code>-linproctrace</code> to the link command.

     <br><dt><code>Using the system's preloading mechanisms</code><dd>
You can force loading the in-process agent at startup time by using
your system's support for preloading shared libraries.  Many Unixes
support the concept of preloading user defined libraries.  In most
cases, you do that by specifying <code>LD_PRELOAD=libinproctrace.so</code>
in the environment.  See also the description of <code>gdbserver</code>'s
<samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> command line option.

     <br><dt><code>Using </code><span class="sc">gdb</span><code> to force loading the agent at run time</code><dd>
On some systems, you can force the inferior to load a shared library,
by calling a dynamic loader function in the inferior that takes care
of dynamically looking up and loading a shared library.  On most Unix
systems, the function is <code>dlopen</code>.  You'll use the <code>call</code>
command for that.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) call dlopen ("libinproctrace.so", ...)
</pre>
     <p>Note that on most Unix systems, for the <code>dlopen</code> function to be
available, the program needs to be linked with <code>-ldl</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>On systems that have a userspace dynamic loader, like most Unix
systems, when you connect to <code>gdbserver</code> using <code>target
remote</code>, you'll find that the program is stopped at the dynamic
loader's entry point, and no shared library has been loaded in the
program's address space yet, including the in-process agent.  In that
case, before being able to use any of the fast or static tracepoints
features, you need to let the loader run and load the shared
libraries.  The simplest way to do that is to run the program to the
main procedure.  E.g., if debugging a C or C<tt>++</tt> program, start
<code>gdbserver</code> like so:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdbserver :9999 myprogram
</pre>
   <p>Start GDB and connect to <code>gdbserver</code> like so, and run to main:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb myprogram
     (gdb) target remote myhost:9999
     0x00007f215893ba60 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     (gdb) b main
     (gdb) continue
</pre>
   <p>The in-process tracing agent library should now be loaded into the
process; you can confirm it with the <code>info sharedlibrary</code>
command, which will list <samp><span class="file">libinproctrace.so</span></samp> as loaded in the
process.  You are now ready to install fast tracepoints, list static
tracepoint markers, probe static tracepoints markers, and start
tracing.
